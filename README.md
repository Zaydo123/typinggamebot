With these selenium scripts you should be able to get highscores and easily soar to the top of typing.com and nitrotype.com

please just have the chromedriver.exe file in the same directory as the two .py files when operating the files or else you will receive an error.

To use, first click initialize, and once you're ready to begin, press the "GO" button in order to start the typing after the 3 second countdown, make sure you click on the google chrome tab before the 3 second countdown is over.

SLIDER: the slider can be adjusted before or after you finish the round of typing. Sliding it all the way down to 0 will make it max speed, and 1 will be unbeleivably slow. I like to leave it on 0, on typing.com I was able to reach to about 2000+ wpm in advanced after 5 tries, results will vary.

let me know of any bugs.


requirements:
pip install selenium
pip install pyautogui
